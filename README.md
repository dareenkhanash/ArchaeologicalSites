## Image Classification for Archaeological Sites using Pre-trained Models

## Overview
Archaeological research often involves the analysis of images to identify and classify various archaeological sites. In this project, we aim to develop a deep learning model for automated image classification of archaeological sites. The utilization of pre-trained models will play a crucial role in achieving accurate and efficient results.
